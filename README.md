This project was created to help me and other incoming college students find new and interesting meals to creat using the ingredients at their disposal. All one needs to do is take a picture of the ingredients they want to use and then the machine learning algorithim will recommend a recipe that contains the ingredients it detected. The model I trained can detect fruits and vegetables with a 94% accuracy.
